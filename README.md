Essay on the Agile Philosophy


Topic: Is Planning Poker useful in estimating game development process for unexperienced developers?

Planning Poker estimation technique has its place in professional teams. In most cases it increases estimation performance of a professional team. But what about unexperienced team, for example, students? Surely, it will increase their ability, as professionals, of estimating backlog, importance of the risks etc. As some practises show, especially when using non-linear estimating numbers, which consist of 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, confidence and performance of both professional and unexperienced teams grow. For example, using these special numbers, in other words - Fibonacci numbers, median estimate of one's own effort was 8 work-hours, whereas, when using linear number, from 1 to 100, median value reached 20 work-hours. However, in professional teams, these numbers do not differ a lot. Knowing how to estimate one's abilities and project's importance is significant part in agile development. Although this might affect students either positively or negatively depending on their personality. This includes one's confidence in his abilities as a developer as the main issue.
